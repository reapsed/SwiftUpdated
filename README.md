Issues with No Fix / Planned Features
Note

These are known issues or upcoming features that are being worked on.

Script editor bugs:

Switching tabs clears active text
Tab autofill doesn't work
Cannot rename files/tabs directly
Planned:

Multi-instance is not yet supported. Might work via third-party tools, but official support is coming soon.
How do I downgrade?
Caution

Downgrading might be detected, likely not but still a risk of being banned. Just as there is a risk with exploiting, you have been warned. Use alts!

You might want to downgrade if Swift hasn‚Äôt updated yet. Here‚Äôs how:

Go to https://rdd.latte.to/?channel=LIVE&binaryType=WindowsPlayer&version=347f4ac346734391 (this is the previous roblox version)
Download and unzip the file
Open RobloxPlayerBeta.exe inside the folder
Inject as normal
How do I disable my antivirus?
Tip

Swift often triggers false positives because of how it operates. Disabling antivirus or adding exceptions is necessary.

Windows Defender (default on all Windows PCs)
Windows 10 Disable Guide
Windows 11 Disable Guide
Add Exceptions Instead (Recommended)
Windows 10 Exceptions Guide
Windows 11 Exceptions Guide
Add these paths:

Your Swift folder
%temp%\Ckfn1k59vk.exe
Important

The file (Ckfn1k59vk.exe) is used by Swift. If it's blocked, you‚Äôll get the Injection Timeout error.

Using McAfee, Norton, AVG, Avast? Just search how to disable or make folder exceptions for your antivirus on YouTube.

Key system Issues
Important

You will encounter key system issues on certain browsers. Please use microsoft edge in an incognito window, this solves most issues

Swift website won‚Äôt load?
Use Warp VPN
Note

If you obtain a key using a VPN, you MUST redeem the key using the same VPN. After that, you can turn it off.

Lootlabs issues?
Disable VPN
Use Quad9 DNS
Refresh stuck tasks
If given an article task, click inside the same tab that opens.
Fatal Error
Close Swift and Roblox completely.

Launch Swift first
Then launch Roblox
Injection Timeout
Note

Have you tried injecting multiple times? For a lot of users the first inject is failing at the moment, but the second or third works.

Important

First, make sure antivirus is disabled and exceptions are added. Defender can silently delete Ckfn1k59vk.exe.

Restore the DLL
Add an Exception
Still getting this error?
Log into an administrator account
Download the latest Roblox
If Roblox is already installed, uninstall it
Install the freshly downloaded one
Log back into your original user account
Launch Swift as admin, then launch Roblox as admin
Alternative (Simpler): Install and run both Swift + Roblox directly from the admin account.

Module not found
Make sure antivirus is disabled
Close both Swift & Roblox
Delete Swift-Module.dll
Relaunch Swift, then Roblox
Failed to relocate module
Ensure antivirus is disabled
Close both Swift and Roblox
Open Swift
When loaded, open Roblox
Your system clock is incorrect
Open Settings ‚Üí Time & Language ‚Üí Date & Time
Enable Set Time Automatically
Click Sync Now
Tip

Still not syncing? Run this file as admin to hopefully sync for you

White screen
Make sure you are running Swift as admin
Ensure your Windows account has admin privileges
What VPN to use
Tip

Warp by Cloudflare is free, simple, and works great with Swift.

Download: Warp VPN
Open it and enable "Cloudflare Warp"
YouTube Setup Guide
Not executing
Press Win + R, type: %localappdata%
Go to Roblox/Versions, delete everything
Visit rdd.latte.to
Set Binary Type: WindowsPlayer
Channel: LIVE
Paste version number from downloaded zip
Drag the zip into the versions folder
Remove Live-WindowsPlayer- from the filename
Extract & run Roblox from inside
Now Swift should execute properly.

Note

Make sure all the following are installed:

.NET 8.0
VC++ x64
VC++ x86
DirectX Runtime
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008

Crash on inject
Download roblox again, you're probably using an outdated version
If roblox just keeps launching an outdated version, use this tool to update for you
Inject on the MENU and not in game
